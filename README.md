This is just a basic proof of concept of a federated search for NRCan using ElasticSearch. Basic idea is to create multiple indexes and types and search them together or independently.

Requires ElasticSearch.

Tested running on Xubuntu 12.04 with ElasticSearch 0.19.8 and PHP5.3

Still need a lot of polishing for setting up the indexes and mappings and then actually creating the indexes. The search (index.php) is very rudimentary.

Also using Twitter Bootstrap for the UI
